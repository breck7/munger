quote
 Here I'm a voice in the wilderness. I would argue that a majority of the horrors we faced would not have happened if the accounting profession were organized properly...they fail utterly time after time after time and they are way too liberal in providing the kind of accounting the financial promoters want...They do not even realize that they've sold out, which of course is a common human psychological phenomenon. You squelch by denial what if you would recognize would make you feel ill of yourself or interfere with your income...on a subconscious level, without any malevolence...the accounting profession is a sewer."
 - Charlie Munger
